#Angular Olympics Services Add-On
Description
Today we are going to update our Olympics Apps to use Angular factories. The goal for this assignment is to refactor all of your controllers to use factory methods to make network requests. The factory should be the only place making requests using the $http service; your controllers should just call methods from the factory and bind to the object returned from the factory. These changes should not change the behavior of the app.

This is a peer challenge with an added twist. Each person is responsible for implementing this refactoring in their partner's project. Fork their repo, work together to determine what changes need to be made, make the necessary changes and submit a Pull Request to your partner's repo. Then, submit your partner's repo as your submission for this assignment.
